This application was created because I like cachaça and I will therefore be scratching a large itch when I am 'working' on it. Finding the Top 10 Brazilian Cachaças by crowdsourcing their discovery and rating system also means Cachaça lovers everywhere can easily find out what fellow aficionados are passionate about.</p>
Cachaça, like rum, has two varieties: unaged (white) and aged (gold). Gold cachaça, usually seen as the "premium" variety, is aged in wood barrels and is meant to be drunk straight (it is usually aged for up to 3 years though some "ultra premium" cachaças have been aged for up to 15 years). Its flavour is influenced by the type of wood the barrel is made from.

Like Capoeristas who had to camouflage their "martial art" by turning it into a dance, in the time of slavery cachaça was consumed as a symbol of resistance to colonial domination and as a demonstration of Brazilian patriotism. The name Bafo de Tigre (or Tigers Breath in English) is a term slaves created for the purpose of deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cachaça was banned in Brazil as it was competing with an European distillate called grapa.
